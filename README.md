## Inspiration
In modern society, people tend to be atomized into individual dots, keeping polite distance from others. Visually impaired people, whose mobility and possible activities are inevitablly restricted. However, there are volunteers who are motivated to help them live a normal life just as are, by offering their help both over the internet and in person. We are creating a platform connecting atomized individuals, helping visually impeded people live up to their independent lives with dignity.

## What it does
![](figs/vhelp.PNG)


Vhelp is a non-profit organization with a large cohert of visually impeded users and volunteers willing to offer assistance in their spare time. Vhelp currently needs a proprietary platform for visually impaired people to seek assistance from nearby volunteers. Volunteers can either call in via the camera at the user's hand, or come in person depending on the concrete situations, to solve various problems run into by users.

## Challenges we ran into
- Andriod app development
- Converting oral expressions of visually impeded users' needs into text for better communication results
- Positioning and matching volunteers to users, and provide navigation for in-person tasks
- Optional feature of monitoring the interaction procedure to reduce risk


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We used Google position services API to grab real-time precise position data of the users and volunteers 
- We used Google speech-to-text API to tackle
